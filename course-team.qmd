[**Florian Shkurti**](https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~florian/) is an assistant professor in computer science at the University of Toronto, where he leads the [Robot Vision and Learning lab](http://rvl.cs.toronto.edu/). He is a faculty member of the University of Toronto Robotics Institute, the Acceleration Consortium, and a faculty affiliate at Vector Institute. His research group 
develops methods that enable robots to learn to perceive, reason, plan, and act effectively and safely, particularly in dynamic environments and alongside humans. Application areas of his research include field robotics for environmental monitoring, visual navigation for autonomous vehicles, and mobile manipulation.

[**Vahid Balazadeh**](https://vahidbalazadeh.me/) I’m a Ph.D. student in Computer Science at the University of Toronto, supervised by Rahul G. Krishnan. I’m interested in understanding the concepts and mechanisms that help humans in optimal decision-making, especially in healthcare. To this end, I’m working on causality and its relationship with machine learning, as well as reinforcement learning from offline observations. In particular, my research involves causal estimation and partial identification of causal effects in high-dimensional data using machine learning. I also like to explore ideas from causality, such as causal representation learning, to design interpretable machine learning methods that are robust to out-of-distribution data.
